# BBEdit-PowerShell

A Codeless Language Module for BBEdit 11.0+ (and TextWrangler 5.5+) on MacOS X

By default, BBEdit's Language Modules folder is located at: 
/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language\ Modules/ 
though if you use Dropbox, you can  move this folder into your Dropbox data folder...

For TextWrangler, this is:
/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/
